# ICT Risk Remediation Roadmap

This remediation roadmap translates the findings of the ICT Risk Register into a prioritised and actionable improvement plan. It supports the institution’s DORA readiness by addressing identified ICT risks affecting the instant payments service in a structured and proportionate manner.

## 1. Approach

The roadmap is:
- **Risk-driven**: Actions are directly derived from identified ICT risk scenarios
- **Service-centric**: Focused on the instant payments service as a critical ICT-supported service
- **Phased**: Sequenced to reflect dependencies between governance, controls, detection, response, and recovery
- **Proportionate**: Includes interim stabilisation measures where appropriate, followed by structured remediation

Not all risks require remediation. One risk (capacity and protocol failure during peak load) is formally accepted based on low likelihood and cost-benefit considerations.

## 2. Timeline

The roadmap is structured across three phases:
- **Month 0–3**: Governance foundations and immediate stabilisation
- **Month 3–6**: Preventive and detection control enhancements
- **Month 6–9**: Incident coordination and end-to-end recovery capabilities

The timeline bars indicate the primary period during which each remediation activity is expected to be implemented.

## 3. Usage

This roadmap is intended to:
- Support management prioritisation and decision-making
- Demonstrate structured remediation planning to supervisors
- Serve as a reference for tracking DORA-related improvements

The roadmap does not replace detailed project plans or control implementation documentation.

### Note:
*An interim mitigation **RM-06** was introduced for RS-06 to reduce operational impact during the period before formal incident management enhancements are implemented. It closes a late-stage exposure gap.*
