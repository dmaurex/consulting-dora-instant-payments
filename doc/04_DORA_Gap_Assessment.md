# DORA Gap Assessment

This document captures the **DORA gap assessment** for the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (Instant Payments) service.

It evaluates **assumed current-state practices** against selected DORA requirements, using the previously defined:

* Engagement scope
* Instant payments architecture
* DORA control mapping

The output identifies **regulatory-relevant gaps** and forms the basis for the ICT risk register and remediation roadmap. This document focuses on **control gaps** rather than full risk quantification.

## 2. How to Use This Document (Consulting Guidance)

* Current-state descriptions are **assumed and illustrative**, not evidence-based
* Gaps are identified based on **regulatory expectations**, not best-case maturity
* Not every gap results in a high-risk finding
* Language is neutral, factual, and non-accusatory

Avoid:

* Absolutist statements ("no controls exist")
* Overly technical detail
* Claims of non-compliance
