# Engagement Overview

This document provides an overview of a simulated consulting engagement with a mid-sized EU retail bank. The engagement focuses on assessing the bank's readiness against the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), scoped specifically to its instant payments service.

## 1. Client Profile

The client profile is designed to reflect a realistic mid-sized EU retail bank facing increasing operational and regulatory pressure due to the expansion of real-time payment services under DORA.

**Client Name (Fictional):** EuroPay Bank S.A.

**Industry:** Retail Banking / Financial Services

**Geography:** European Union (Eurozone)

**Size:** Mid-sized retail bank (~1–3 million customers)

**Key Services:**
* Retail current and savings accounts
* SEPA Instant Credit Transfers (SCT Inst)
* Online and mobile banking
* Card-based payments

**Regulatory Context:**
EuroPay Bank S.A. is subject to EU financial regulation, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). As part of its payments strategy, the bank has expanded its use of **SEPA Instant Payments**, increasing its dependency on ICT systems, third-party service providers, and real-time transaction processing. The instant payment service has been introduced incrementally, largely leveraging existing systems, processes, and governance frameworks that were not originally designed for real-time, high-availability payment processing.

The bank is conducting a DORA readiness assessment to evaluate whether its ICT risk management practices adequately support the resilience requirements for instant payment services.

## 2. Engagement Objective

The objective of this engagement is to provide management with a structured and risk-based view of DORA readiness for instant payments, including:

* Assess EuroPay Bank’s readiness against **key DORA ICT risk management requirements** as they apply to instant payment services
* Identify gaps in governance, risk management, and incident handling related to ICT-supported payment processing
* Provide a prioritized remediation roadmap aligned with regulatory expectations and industry good practices

This engagement is designed as a **readiness and gap assessment**, not a formal compliance audit.

## 3. In-Scope

The following elements are included in scope:

### 3.1 Business Service in Scope

* **SEPA Instant Credit Transfers (Instant Payments)**

This includes:

* Real-time transaction initiation, processing, and settlement
* Customer-facing digital channels (online and mobile banking) supporting instant payments
* Core payment processing platforms and interfaces with clearing and settlement mechanisms

### 3.2 DORA Scope

The assessment focuses on selected DORA requirements related to:

* **ICT risk management framework** (Articles 5–12)
* ICT risk identification and assessment
* ICT governance and roles & responsibilities
* High-level ICT incident management and escalation processes

### 3.3 Frameworks and References

* Digital Operational Resilience Act (EU) 2022/2554
* ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (control reference)
* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 (control reference)

---

## 4. Out-of-Scope

The following areas are explicitly excluded from scope:

* Other business services (e.g. card payments, lending platforms)
* Detailed technical security testing (e.g. penetration testing, vulnerability scanning)
* ICT third-party risk deep-dive assessments
* DORA requirements related to advanced threat-led penetration testing (TLPT)
* Regulatory reporting submissions or supervisory interactions

---

## 5. Key Assumptions

The assessment is based on the following assumptions:

* The client environment, processes, and controls are **hypothetical and representative** of a mid-sized EU retail bank
* Current-state controls are assessed based on **assumed practices**, not evidence-based validation
* Third-party service providers are considered at a high level only
* The assessment reflects a **point-in-time view** of DORA readiness

These assumptions are consistent with a high-level readiness assessment and do not replace a formal regulatory compliance review.

---

## 6. Methodology

The engagement follows a structured consulting methodology:

1. **Scoping and service definition**

   * Identification of the critical business service (SEPA Instant Payments)
   * Definition of service boundaries and dependencies

2. **High-level service architecture**

   * Identification of core systems, interfaces, and external dependencies supporting instant payments
   * Establishment of a service-centric architectural view

3. **Regulatory requirement analysis**

   * Identification of relevant DORA requirements
   * Mapping of regulatory requirements to recognized control frameworks

4. **Gap assessment**

   * Assessment of assumed current-state practices against DORA expectations
   * Identification of governance, process, and control gaps

5. **ICT risk identification**

   * Identification of key ICT risk scenarios affecting instant payments
   * Consideration of availability, integrity, and resilience

6. **Risk assessment**

   * Assessment of ICT risks regarding likelihood and severity
   * Proposing risk treatments and remediation actions

7. **Remediation planning**

   * Risk-based prioritisation of remediation actions
   * Development of a phased remediation roadmap

---

## 7. Key Deliverables

The following deliverables are produced as part of the engagement:

* Engagement overview and scope definition
* Architecture of instant payment service 
* DORA control mapping (DORA ↔ ISO 27001 ↔ NIST CSF)
* ICT risk scenarios and risk register for instant payments
* DORA gap assessment and findings
* Prioritized remediation roadmap
