# DORA Control Mapping

This document defines the **control mapping backbone** for the DORA readiness assessment focused on **SEPA Instant Payments**.

It translates selected DORA requirements into:

* Plain-language expectations
* Impacted architecture components
* Reference controls from ISO 27001:2022 and NIST CSF 2.0

This mapping is used to:

* Drive the gap assessment
* Anchor ICT risk identification
* Ensure regulatory traceability

---

## 1. How to Use This Mapping (Consulting Guidance)

* This is **not** a legal interpretation of DORA
* Requirements are summarized pragmatically, as done in consulting engagements
* Mapping to ISO/NIST is indicative and supports control benchmarking
* One DORA requirement may map to **multiple controls**

---

## 2. Scope of DORA Requirements Covered

The mapping covers selected requirements from:

* **Article 5 - Governance and organisation**
* **Article 6 - ICT risk management framework**
* **Article 7 - ICT systems, protocols and tools**
* **Article 8 - Identification**
* **Article 9 - Protection and prevention**
* **Article 10 - Detection**
* **Article 11 - Response and recovery**
* **Article 12 - Backup policies and procedures, restoration and recovery procedures and methods**
