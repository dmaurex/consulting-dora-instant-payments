# ICT Risk Scenarios

This document defines a set of **ICT risk scenarios** for the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (Instant Payments) service.

The scenarios are:

* Directly derived from the **DORA gap assessment**
* Focused on **service-level impact**
* Structured to support subsequent **ICT risk assessment** and **remediation planning**

The objective is to translate identified regulatory gaps into **assessable ICT risk scenarios**.

## 2. How to Read and Use the Scenarios (Consulting Guidance)

* Scenarios describe **what could go wrong**, not confirmed incidents
* Likelihood and impact are not yet quantified
* One scenario may address multiple gaps
* Wording is intentionally neutral and supervisory in tone

Avoid:

* Threat actor narratives
* Excessive technical detail
* Overlapping or duplicate scenarios
