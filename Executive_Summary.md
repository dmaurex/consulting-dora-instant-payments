## Executive Summary

**DORA Readiness Assessment – Instant Payments**

This consulting case presents a targeted **DORA readiness assessment** of a mid-sized EU retail bank's **instant payments service**, with a specific focus on ICT risk management, incident handling, and operational resilience requirements under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).

Instant payments constitute a **time-critical, high-availability ICT-supported service** with heightened regulatory expectations due to their real-time nature, customer impact, and dependency on complex internal and external ICT components. The assessment was conducted using a **service-centric risk-based approach**, aligned with DORA’s emphasis on critical functions rather than individual systems.

---

## Key Findings

The assessment identified that while the bank operates a broadly stable instant payments capability, **DORA alignment gaps remain** across governance, dependency management, detection, incident coordination, and recovery preparedness. These gaps do not necessarily indicate control absence, but rather **insufficient formalisation, service-specific tailoring, and end-to-end integration**, which are critical under DORA.

The most material risk themes identified were:

* Incomplete **service-level governance and risk ownership** for instant payments
* Insufficient **mapping and management of critical ICT dependencies**, including third parties
* Detection and monitoring capabilities **not fully aligned to real-time service expectations**
* Incident coordination and recovery arrangements **not fully tested end-to-end** for instant payments

---

## Remediation Strategy and Roadmap

A **phased ICT Risk Remediation Roadmap (0–9 months)** was developed to address the identified risks in a **proportionate, defensible, and realistic manner**. The roadmap balances immediate stabilisation measures with structural improvements, reflecting common supervisory expectations for DORA remediation programmes.

### Phase 1 – Foundation and Immediate Risk Reduction (Month 0–3)

The initial phase focuses on **governance clarity and risk visibility**:

* Formal designation of instant payments as a **critical ICT-supported service**, including management body approval of service-level risk appetite (RM-01)
* Establishment of **service-centric dependency mapping**, covering both internal systems and external ICT providers (RM-02)
* Introduction of **interim incident escalation arrangements** to reduce coordination risk prior to full playbook development (RM-06)

This phase ensures early risk reduction and demonstrates management commitment, even before structural controls are fully implemented.

---

### Phase 2 – Control and Detection Maturity (Month 3–6)

The second phase strengthens **preventive and detective capabilities**:

* Integration of instant payments into **ICT risk management and third-party risk assessments** (RM-03)
* Tailoring of **access control, segregation of duties, and integrity controls** to instant payment requirements (RM-04)
* Implementation of **instant payment-specific detection thresholds, alerts, and KPIs** aligned with real-time availability expectations (RM-05)

This phase materially improves the bank’s ability to **prevent, detect, and justify** its control environment under supervisory scrutiny.

---

### Phase 3 – Resilience, Coordination, and Recovery (Month 6–9)

The final phase addresses **end-to-end operational resilience**:

* Development and formalisation of **incident response playbooks** specific to instant payments (RM-07)
* Alignment of incident coordination procedures with **clearing and settlement counterparties** (RM-08)
* Definition and testing of **end-to-end recovery scenarios**, including reconciliation activities (RM-09, RM-10)

This phase ensures that the bank can **demonstrate recoverability**, not just redundancy, in line with DORA expectations.

---

## Overall Assessment

The proposed remediation roadmap provides:

* Clear **traceability from identified ICT risks to remediation actions**
* A **phased and proportionate implementation plan** aligned with operational realities
* A defensible narrative for **management bodies and supervisors**

If executed as designed, the roadmap would significantly improve the bank’s **DORA readiness for instant payments**, particularly in areas most scrutinised by regulators: service criticality, dependency management, detection timeliness, and recovery assurance.

The risk reduction is shown in the diagram below when followed the advised roadmap:

This way DORA-aligned ICT resilience can be achieved without system redesign.

*This case is presented as a simulated consulting engagement to demonstrate ICT risk, governance, and regulatory advisory capabilities in a DORA context.*
